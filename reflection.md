- What are your initial impressions of how `Association` affectes your programming?
I think this contextualizes the Association relationship between different class objects. For example, I can see clearly that the Pants.java, Shirt.java, Banner.java, and Boot.java is part of what constitutes the Scarecrow.java. The Scarecrow cannot exist independently without their building blocks. I initially got confused to how is Association manifested in the code, then I realize I am doing it without noticing: using a class objects as the parameters for the Scarecrow class objects.

- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?
The ASCII arts were very fun to work with. I can get very creative with how my Scarecrow looks without struggling to much with the actual coding. However, I ran into the problem with taking in a commandline argument. It shows that there is an "Error: Could not find or load main class Scarecrow" message. I went to ask the TA but they also couldn't figure out why this happened. I also tried exploring alternative solutions such as "run javac Scarecrow.java", and even download the actual java. Yet, none of them worked.
